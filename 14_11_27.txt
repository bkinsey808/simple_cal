Thursday (Jupiter day 5/7)

Thanksgiving, Black Thursday {US}: many historians argue US Thanksgiving has its origins as a celebration of the Puritan victory against the Pequot natives in southern New England. Massachusetts Bay Governor William Bradford designated "a day of thanksgiving kept in all the churches for our victories against the Pequots", starting a New England thanksgiving tradition that eventually became the model for the federal holiday declared in 1863 by Abraham Lincoln. 700 Pequots were killed or taken into captivity, and the Pequot nation ceased to exist as a polity. It was therefore, as far as I know, the first significant genocide against natives in the northern part of North America. According to history, the Pequot survivors were rounded up and sold as slaves to the west Indies. In return, the Puritans got a ship full of black slaves, setting the tone and ethical backdrop of what would eventually become the largest genocide in human history, the killing of over 100 million natives in North America. Black Thursday is a new and very appropriate anti-capitalist name of Thanksgiving, now that many retail workers are forced to work it.
