Saturday (Saturn day 7/7)

International Day of Solidarity with Palestinian People: After seven years of Israeli blockade, 1.7 million Palestinians continue to be trapped in the Gaza Strip, largely cut off from the outside world. Gaza has witnessed its worst destruction in decades with vital infrastructure such as water systems, sanitation and health services badly damaged by the recent violence. More than 100,000 people have had their homes destroyed. Twenty-five per cent of the population in Gaza - 450,000 people - currently have no access to running water and most areas of Gaza are now without electricity for 18 hours a day. Many schools, businesses and workshops have been damaged and some completely destroyed. At the same time, farmers have been unable to access their fields to plant their new season of crops. The blockade - now in place for seven years - has devastated Gaza's economy, left most people unable to leave Gaza, restricted people from essential services such as healthcare and education, and cut Palestinians off from each other. More than 40% of people in Gaza - nearly 70% of youth - are now unemployed and 80% of people receive aid. Many key industries, such as the construction industry, have been decimated as essential materials are not allowed into Gaza. Exports are currently at less than 2% of their pre-blockade levels, with the transfer of agricultural produce and other goods to Palestinian markets in the West Bank almost entirely banned.
