November 21, 2014

Starting on this day, in celebration of the upcoming new moon, I've decided to more closely follow the Chinese calendar:

Bǐng Shēn: Yang Fire Monkey, day 33 of the sexegenary (60 day) cycle called Liùshí Huājiǎ, the stem and branch cycle. The last day of the ninth lunar month. Also the last day of the solar term Lìdōng.

Amanta Kartika Shivaratri, Purnimanta Margashirsha Shivaratri, Karthika Bahula Chaturdashi: Mruthyunjaya (form of Shiva) puja brings relief from diseases and brings a healthy body and mind. (Note that this is a monthly Shivaratri, not Mahashivaratri.)

At sunset, Sigd: (Ge'ez for "prostration") a Jewish Ethiopian holiday symbolizing the acceptance of the Torah. Also, in remembrance of persecution by Christian kings, during which the Kessim retreated into the wilderness to appeal to God for His mercy. A day of pilgrimage to locations of relief from Christian persecution.

Muku: ("cut-off") The new moon; the end of the Hawaiian lunar month. A day for planting crops. A day of low tide, diving for sea-urchins, for gathering seaweed, for line-fishing by children, squid-catching, uluulu fishing, and pulu fishing.

2:33am (November 22): New Moon, Moon in conjunction with Venus
