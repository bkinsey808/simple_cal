Buy Nothing Day: Biggest shopping day of the year and you're supposed to buy nothing -- and miss all those sales?! Let's follow at least the SPIRIT of this holiday -- if not the literal interpretation. Think about shopping the day after Thanksgiving -- is it because you really NEED all that stuff, or because society has institutionalized the experience? I know, you're buying holiday gifts.

Shop because you get a positive benefit from the activity -- not because it is EXPECTED of you.
