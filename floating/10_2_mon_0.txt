Canadian Thanksgiving: {CA} Thanksgiving is a statutory holiday in most jurisdictions of Canada, with the exceptions being the Atlantic provinces of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, where it is an optional holiday.[1] Companies that are regulated by the federal government (such as those in the telecommunications and banking sectors) recognize the holiday regardless of its provincial status.

Columbus Day (celebrated): {US} October 12th has historically been known as Columbus Day in America. In 1937, 32nd President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt actually proclaimed the date to be a national holiday. However, in 1971, American celebrations of Columbus Day were switched to the second Monday of October each year. Even so, October 12th is the traditional date for Columbus Day, a day of both celebration and controversy.

Native American Day: {South Dakota} In 1989 the South Dakota legislature unanimously passed legislation proposed by Governor George S. Mickelson to proclaim 1990 as the "Year of Reconciliation" between Native Americans and whites, to change Columbus Day to Native American Day and to make Martin Luther King's birthday into a state holiday. Since 1990 the second Monday in October has been celebrated as Native American Day in South Dakota.
