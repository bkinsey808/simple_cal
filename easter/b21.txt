Laetare Sunday, Mothering Sunday, Sunday of the Five Loaves: 3 weeks, 21 days before Easter. Laetare Sunday (pron.: /liːˈtɛərɪ/ or /laɪˈtɑrɪ/ as in ecclesiastical Latin), so called from the incipit of the Introit at Mass, "Laetare Jerusalem" ("O be joyful, Jerusalem"), (from Isaiah 66:10, masoretic text) is a name often used to denote the fourth Sunday of the season of Lent in the Christian liturgical calendar. This Sunday is also known as Mothering Sunday, Refreshment Sunday, Mid-Lent Sunday (in French mi-carême), and Rose Sunday (either because the golden rose sent by the popes to Catholic sovereigns used to be blessed at this time or because the use of rose-colored vestments instead of violet ones was permitted). The term "Laetare Sunday" is used predominantly, though not exclusively, by Roman Catholics and some Anglicans. The word translates from the Latin laetare, singular imperative of laetari to rejoice. This Sunday was also once known as "the Sunday of the Five Loaves," from the traditional Gospel reading for the day, the story of the miracle of the loaves and fishes, which was, before the adoption of the modern "common" lectionaries, the Gospel reading for this Sunday in the Lutheran, Anglican, Roman Catholic, Western-rite Orthodox, and Old Catholic churches. In the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and some Protestant traditions, there may be flowers on the high altar, the organ may be played as a solo instrument, and priests are given the option to wear rose-coloured vestments at Mass held on this day, in place of the violet vestments normally worn during Lent. The day is a day of relaxation from normal Lenten rigours; a day of hope with Easter being at last within sight. Traditionally, even weddings (otherwise banned during Lent) could be performed on this day.
