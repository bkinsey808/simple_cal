Holy Saturday,  Great Sabbath, Black Saturday, Sabbatum Sanctum, Easter Eve:	Commemorates the day that Jesus Christ's body lay in the tomb. Last day of Holy Week. Liturgically speaking, Holy Saturday lasts until 6pm or dusk, after which the Easter Vigil is celebrated, marking the official start of the Easter season. The rubrics state that the Easter Vigil must take place in the night; it must begin after nightfall and end before dawn. The service may start with a fire and the lighting of the new Paschal candle. In Roman Catholic and some Anglican observance, the Mass is the first Mass since that of Maundy Thursday, and during it, the "Gloria" - which has been absent during Lent - is used, and during that "Gloria", the church statues and icons, in places where they are covered with purple veils during Passiontide, are dramatically unveiled. Some Anglican churches prefer to celebrate Easter and the lighting of the new Paschal candle at dawn on Easter Day. Baptisms may take place in this service and Baptism vows are often renewed.
