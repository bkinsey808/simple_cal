Vocem Juncunditatis Sunday, Rogation Sunday: farmers prayed for a good harvest, and pastor and people walked from the church into the fields to pray for God’s blessing on the planted crops. All this recalls the ancient Biblical practice as well as Solomon’s familiar verse: “Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set” (Prov. 22:28). Each generation was summoned to honor the boundary marks, not only of the fields, but of moral law.

Rogationtide: 4 days, starts on Rogoation Sunday, ends on Ascension Thursday. Traditionally a time when prayers are made for God’s blessing on the land, livestock and crops in the hope of a good harvest.
