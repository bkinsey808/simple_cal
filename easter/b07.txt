Palm Sunday, Palmarum Sunday: One week before Easter, the 6th Sunday of Lent. The feast commemorates Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, an event mentioned in all four canonical Gospels.In many Christian churches, Palm Sunday includes a procession of the assembled worshipers carrying palms, representing the palm branches the crowd scattered in front of Jesus as he rode into Jerusalem. According to the Gospels, Jesus rode a donkey into Jerusalem, and the celebrating people there laid down their cloaks in front of him, and also laid down small branches of trees. In Luke 19:41 as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it (an event known as Flevit super illam in Latin language), foretelling the suffering that awaits the city.
