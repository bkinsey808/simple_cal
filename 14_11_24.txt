I took Sue Rainbow's advice and finally moved the sacred calendar over to a blog. Actually I repurposed an old blog. I think I like wordpress's categories sidebar much better than blogspot's, so I'll stick with wordpress for now until I feel motivated to explore further.

Monday (Moon day 2/7)

Evolution Day {science}: the anniversary of the first publication of The Origin of Species on November 24, 1859.

Jǐ Hài (Yin Earth Pig stem-branch 34/60) {Chinese}

Kūkahi (first Kū day 3/30) {Hawai'ian}: the first of the four Kū moons. Night is kapu to Kū. Kapu is the word for forbidden and this is a time that is dedicated to worship and prayer. Kū is the god of war but another of meaning of Kū is strong and erect, to grow upright. Hawaiians observed that plants (such as sweet potato, taro, and banana) grow strong and more erect when planted during the Kū phases. It could be said that the Kū shows us to stand tall and strong with masculine spirit. Daylight fishing on reef. 

Śukla Dvitīya (waxing tithi 2/15) {Hindu}: Vidhatr or Bramha rules this lunar day. Good for the laying of foundations for buildings and other things of a permanent nature and is a good tithi in general.
