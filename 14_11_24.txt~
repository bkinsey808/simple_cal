Kūkahi (first Kū day 3/30) {Hawai'ian}: the first of the four Kū moons. Night is kapu to Kū. Kapu is the word for forbidden and this is a time that is dedicated to worship and prayer. Kū is the god of war but another of meaning of Kū is strong and erect, to grow upright. Hawaiians observed that plants (such as sweet potato, taro, and banana) grow strong and more erect when planted during the Kū phases. It could be said that the Kū shows us to stand tall and strong with masculine spirit. Daylight fishing on reef.
