<p>Event Tool searches for various solar, lunar and planetary events. The following events can be
detected by Event Tool: Solstices, equinoxes, peri/aphelion, lunar phases, lunar perigee/apogee, inferior/superior 
conjunctions of Mercury and Venus, solar conjunctions/oppositions of outer planets, greatest elongations
of Mercury and Venus, mutual conjunctions involving two planets or the Moon and a planet.</p>

<h3><a name="usage">Usage</a></h3>

<p>Brief instructions: <br>
To use Ephemeris Tool set your location and time zone, specify start date and 
desired time span. Mark the desired events and click 'Search'.</p>

<p><b>Important</b><br>
The search can take a considerable time depending on the speed of your computer, the browser used and 
the requested time span. Don't panic if it looks like your browser hangs. It is just thinking! 
Newer versions of Mozilla (and Firefox) may occasionally show an alert box  
warning that "A script is causing mozilla to run slow" and offering you to abort it. 
Just click "Cancel" to continue running the script.</p>

<p>For help concerning the Location and Date and Time interfaces, please see the help manual for 
Ephemeris Tool. Event Tool shares the observatory cookie with other tools
in the Astrotools suite</p> 

<h4>Events</h4>

<p>Check the checkboxes for all desired events before clicking Search. The search may take some time as mentioned
above. The results will be presented in a new window.</p>

<p>The 'Seasons' and 'Moon phases' buttons are shortcuts for searching for astronomical seasons and lunar phases
independent of the checked events.</p>
 
<p>See the <a href="glossary.html" target=_blank>glossary</a> 
if you need explanations for the terms used</p>

<hr>
<h4>Precision</h4>
<p>The program achieves sufficient accuracy for normal observational purposes. Moon phases and conjunctions
with planets are accurate to
a few minutes from the correct values. 
The uncertainties on conjunction times involving the slower Sun and planets are greater. The positions used for
calculating events have an accuracy of about 2 arcminutes and the uncertainty is related to the time it takes
the planet or Sun to move this angle.
The times for peri/aphelions and greatest elongations can be off by a few hours from the values calculated
using more precise methods.</p>
<p>Event Tool uses the following theories for calculating planetary and lunar positions: 
Planetary calculations are based on the formulae in 
<a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/english.html">Paul Schlyter's</a> article 
<a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html">"Computing planetary positions"</a>. 
He claims a precision of about 2 arcminutes on positions. 
Lunar calculations use a truncated version of the method presented in "Astronomical Algorithms", 
2nd edition by Jean Meeus. Lunar positions should be good to about 1 arcminute. 
"Astronomical Algorithms" is a strongly recommended book for anybody interested in performing astronomical
calculations. It has helped me with various formulae for translating between 
coordinate systems, calculating rise and set times and much more. 
Please note that the theories only provide the specified precision between 1000 AD and 3000 AD or so. 
Outside this time interval errors will grow quickly.</p>
 
<hr>
<h3><a name="browser">Browser notes</a></h3>

<p>Event Tool is demanding on the javascript interpreter of the browser and requires CSS2 support. 
Older browsers may crash or report errors. Most recent browsers should be able to run Event Tool. 
Recommended browsers are Mozilla 1.7, Firefox and Internet Explorer 6 or better. 
The script has been tested on various computers 
with the following browsers running under Windows 98 SE, ME, 2000 and XP:<br>
<b>Mozilla 1.7.3</b>, <b>Firefox 1.0</b> and <b>Internet Explorer 6</b></p>

<p>Speed: The speed of Event Tool depends on the computer, browser and search time span. 
Time spans of more than a couple of months may require a considerable time to execute (and possibly
alert boxes in some browsers as mentioned above).
