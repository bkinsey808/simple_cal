Totensonntag: a memorial day or a "silent day", a general celebration in memorial of the deceased

Stir-up Sunday: {anglican} an informal term in Anglican churches for the last Sunday before the season of Advent. Traditionally, families gather together in the kitchen of their homes to bake and enjoy Christmas pudding on a Stir up Sunday. Parents teach their children how to mix ingredients for the pudding. Everyone will get a turn to mix, and an opportunity to utter a wish. In some households, elders put coins in the pudding mix and allow children to find them. It is believed that finding a coin brings wealth, health, happiness for the coming year.
