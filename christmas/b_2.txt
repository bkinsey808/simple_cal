Gaudete Sunday: the third Sunday of Advent in the liturgical calendar of the Western Church, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Lutheran Churches, and other mainline Protestant churches. It can fall on any date from 11 December to 17 December. The day takes its common name from the Latin word Gaudete ("Rejoice"), the first word of the introit of this day's Mass: Rejoice!
