Pesach Sheni: second Passover: Due to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, Jews are unable to perform the Passover sacrifice, neither on Passover nor on Pesach Sheni. Some have the custom to eat matzo during Pesach Sheni in memory of the sacrifice. Some have the custom to omit Tahanun from the daily prayer service, though this custom is not observed universally
