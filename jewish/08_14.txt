Lord's Evening Meal: {jehovah's witnesses} Jehovah's Witnesses commemorate Jesus' death as a ransom sacrifice or "propitiatory sacrifice" by observing the Lord's Evening Meal, or Memorial. They celebrate it once per year, noting that it was instituted on the Passover, an annual festival.[1] They observe it on Nisan 14 according to the Hebrew calendar. Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that this is the only celebration the Bible commands Christians to observe.
