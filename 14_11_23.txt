Sunday (Sun day 1/7)

Amanta Mārgaśīrṣa (Orion new moon month 9/12), Shukla Prathama (waxing tithi 1/15) {Hindu}: another name for this month is Agrahāyaṇa (equinox), which gives an interesting clue as to the age of the Hindu calendar: the names of the month may have been given when the sun was near Orion at the time of vernal equinox, ~7000 years ago. One of the most auspicious months for Hindus, throughout it devotees can be seen involved in bhajans/kirtans. A ritual bath this month in the Ganga is also very auspicious. Parathama tithi is presided by Agni, good for all types of auspicious and religious ceremonies.

Ṣafar (Empty month 2/12, at sunset) {Islam}: during this Islamic month the houses used to be empty and deserted because the ban on going to war in the month of Muḥarram came to an end and everyone proceeded towards the battlefield.

Qawl (Speech month 14/19) {Bahá'í}: in the Bahá'í tradition there are 19 months of 19 days each (plus four or five intercalary days).

Feast of Ullr {Ásatrú}: to celebrate the Hunt and to gain personal luck needed for success. Weapons are dedicated on this day to Ullr, God of the Bow. If your hunting arms were blessed by the luck of the God of the Hunt, your family and tribe shared the bounty with a Blot and Feast to Ullr.

Wù Xū (Yang Earth Dog stem-branch 35/60) {Chinese}

Hoaka (Make Shadow day 2/30) {Hawai'ian}: The name Hoaka is said to be contraction of Ho’o Aka meaning to make shadow. This is thought be the first moon bright enough to cast a shadow. Aka is a beautiful word that means shadow, reflection, likeness, embryo at the moment of conception, and the stage of a fish when its body is still transparent. Hoaka also means spirit, apparition, ghost. "Fish may be frightened away by the spirit of this Moon." Nonetheless, torch fishing good on reef. Low tide till morning. Good day for planting, especially sweet potatoes. Kapu to Kū, god of war.
