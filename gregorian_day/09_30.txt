Blasphemy Day, International Blasphemy Rights Day: Blasphemy Day is celebrated on September 30 to coincide with the anniversary of the publication of satirical drawings of Muhammad in one of Denmark's newspapers, resulting in the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. Although the caricatures of Muhammad caused some controversy within Denmark, especially among Muslims, it became a global furor after Muslim imams around the world stirred up violent protests in which at least 137 people were killed, embassies burned and other acts of recrimination carried out because of the alleged blasphemy.
