Divalia: {Roman} To Angerona and also to Dia, goddess of the Arval brothers.

On the day of this festival the pontifices performed sacrifices in the temple of Voluptia, or the goddess of joy and pleasure, who, some say, was the same with Angerona, and supposed to drive away all the sorrow and chagrin of life.
