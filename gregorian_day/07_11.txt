World Population Day: {UN} Day to meditate on the social and environmental costs of overpopulation. [The world's 8th billion baby is expected to born in 2027. The world's population reached 1 billion in 1804, 2 billion in 1927, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion in 1974, 5 billion in 1987, 6 billion in 1999, and 7 billion in 2011. Is this growth sustainable? Will the world have enough food, fresh water, medicine, and other needed resources for each person?]

Cheer Up the Lonely Day:
