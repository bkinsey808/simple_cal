Something on a Stick Day: {foodie}

Death day of Scott Cunningham: {Wicca} (1993), who taught a reverent, ethical, egalitarian, and ecological form of Wicca. Wiccans create sacred space by calling on the powers of the four directions, invoke the Lord and Lady in their various guises, and raise power (through drumming, dance, and chant) to realize a positive purpose.

Sacrifice at the Tombs: {Roman} This later festival was held later in the Empire to honor one's ancestors at their tomb.
