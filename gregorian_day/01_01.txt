#Solemnity of #Mary: {#Roman #Catholic} The feast is a #celebration of Mary's #motherhood of Jesus. On this day in 1990, Pope John Paul II exhorted Christians to respect #Nature, to #preserve #natural #resources, and to stop #environmental destruction. Citing Genesis, the Pope said that, because responsibility for Creation was entrusted by Deity to humankind, the #ecological crisis is a moral issue of human responsibility. He believed the ecological crisis was caused by a lack of respect for life. He said that it implicates #planetary peace as well as the quality of life of all. He was concerned about the depletion of the ozone layer, massive urban concentrations, vastly increased #energy needs, #industrial #waste, the burning of #fossil #fuels, unrestricted #deforestation, and the use of certain types of #herbicides, coolants and propellants. He also expressed concern about #GMO plants and animals. He exhorted governments to #cooperate #internationally, and to internally adopt internationally-accepted standards, to ensure #preservation of the #environment.
