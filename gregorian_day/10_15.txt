Ludi Capitolini, Capitoline Games: {Roman} The Ludi Capitolini were games held in honor of Jupiter Capitolini, and was only celebrated by his priests. They may have originally been held to honor Jupiter Feretrius.

Ides of October: {Roman} The October Ides featured a two-horse chariot race on the Campus Martius and slaughter of the October Horse, i.e. the outer horse of the winning pair. Its tail was cut off and carried to the Regia where blood was dropped on the hearth while the head was also removed and taken elsewhere. This festival perhaps harkened all the way back to the days of the Indo-Europeans.
