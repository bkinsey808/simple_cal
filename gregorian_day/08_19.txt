World Humanitarian Day: {UN}
	
Vinalia Rustica: {Roman} "To Jupiter and Venus. Important for vine growers, probably corresponding to the times of harvest and crushing of grapes. This day was also a holiday for gardeners. ""Rural Festival of the Vine"". This feast was held to ask Jupiter  to not send storms, hail, heavy rains, or floods before the grapes could ripen and be harvested, and to ask him when the best time to harvest said grapes would be. Venus was also honored during the Vinalia Rustica as a goddess of vegetation and gardens."

Freyfaxi: {Asatru} marked the time of the harvest in ancient Iceland. Today the Asatru observe this date as a celebration of their harvest with blot to Freyr and a grand Feast from the gardens and the fields.

National Aviation Day: {us} The holiday was established in 1939 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who issued a presidential proclamation which designated the anniversary of Orville Wright's birthday to be National Aviation Day (Mr. Wright, born in 1871, was still alive when the proclamation was first issued, and would live another nine years).
