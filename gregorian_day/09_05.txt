Ludi Romani: {Roman} In the early days of Rome, prior to battle a desperate general would make a solemn vow to Jupiter to hold games in the god's honor if only the Romans might win. If this happened and the state granted him a triumph, the general would hold ludi magni, votivi. The triumphal procession would lead from the Capitoline Hill to the Circus, where the chariots were raced on the last five days of the festival. The prior days were given to theatrical performances, i.e. pantomimes, comedies and tragedies. One day was given over to the Epulum Iovis and one to the Transvectio Equitum, the parade of the Equites. The popular idea that the games were always gladiatorial combats is a myth for Republican times and even during the early empire, certainly up to 169 BC. Hunting, venatio and combat were not part of the Ludi, but of the Munera, originally an Etruscan religious tradition, practiced at the death of a chief, where it was thought that spilling blood would give strength to his spirit. The Ludi Romani proved so popular that they were instituted in the calendar as a regular event, as early as 366 BC when the office of aedile may have been created to regulate them. These games were later extended by a day because of a proposal by Marcus Antonius to honor the dead Julius Caesar, never mind that he already had games in his honor. By the late Republic, many of Rome's most prominent persons, e.g. Cicero, avoided the associated crowds by escaping to the comforts of a rustic villa, perhaps in a cooler clime near the sea. The last chariot races at the Circus Maximus were held in AD 549 under a German chieftain.
