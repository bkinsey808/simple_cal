Neither Rain Nor Snow Day, Postal Workers Day: "Neither snow nor rain not heat, nor gloom of night, stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds." This slogan has long been attributed to the United States Postal Service, honoring mail carriers. In fact, the quotation was inscribed on the outside of the James Farley Post Office , New York City's primary postal location, which was dedicated on September 7, 1914.
