International Farmers' Day: On April 17, 1996, nineteen members of a farmers’ organization in Brazil were massacred when police opened fire on thousands of demonstrators demanding land reform. The victims were members of the Landless Movement (MST) of Brazil, a country where 1 percent of landholders own 50 percent of the land – and landless rural people are subject to torture and violence from police and vigilantes.
