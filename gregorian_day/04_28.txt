Floralia, Ludi Floriales: {Roman} To Flora, goddess of flowers, and thus a fertility celebration. Dating from 173 BC, these games were known for being licentious. Later Maypole (a rather phallic symbol) festivities are probably a successor. Presumably the crops should have been sown just prior to this and warm weather arriving, so it would be a good time for a festival. Usually only the last day featured chariot racing. There was also a strip-tease performance by prostitutes. Once Cato the Younger left the theater rather than view this scene. Also featured tables piled high with flowers and people wearing bright garlands. Important for vine growers.
