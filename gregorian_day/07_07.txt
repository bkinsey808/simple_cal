Parilia: {Roman} Festivals for Pales, goddess of herds. During these festivals, ritualistic cleansing of sheep/cattle pens and animals would take place. The shepherd would sweep out the pens and smudge the animals and pens with burning sulfur. In the evening, the animals were sprinkled with water, and their pens were decorated with garlands. Fires were started, and in were thrown olives, horse blood, beanstalks without pods, and the ashes from the Fordicalia fires. Men and beasts jumped over the fire three times to purify themselves further, and to bring them protection from anything that might harm them (wolves, sickness, starvation, etc.). After the animals were put back into their pens the shepherds would offer non-blood sacrifices of grain, cake millet, and warm milk to Pales. The festival in April was for smaller livestock, while the one in July was for larger animals. The Parilia took place on the same day as the traditional day for the founding of Rome.

Nonae Caprotinae: {Roman} "Nones of the Wild Fig", also called "Feast of the Serving Women". This festival was held to honor Juno Caprotina, and a sacrifice was given to her under a wild fig tree. It also celebrates the serving women who helped free the city of Rome from the Gauls. Kennet says the origin of this feast, or the famous Nonae Caprotinae, or Poplifugium, is doubly related by Plutarch, according to the two common opinions. First, because Romulus disappeared on that day, when an assembly being held in the Palus Capreae, or Goats'-Marsh, suddenly a storm broke, accompanied with terrible thunder, and other unusual disorders in the air (see Plutarch's Life of Numa). The common people fled all away to secure themselves; but, after the tempest was over, could never find Romulus, their king.
