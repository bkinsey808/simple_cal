Originally celebrated on March 27 when the statue of the Great Mother was washed. This single day was in the second century AD expanded to several days when games were held in honor of Cybele, the Great Mother, a goddess represented by a large stone brought to Rome in 204 BC by instruction of the Oracle of Delphi. Transported all the way from Pessinus in Asia Minor, its arrival must have seen auspicious as it coincided with Rome's final victory over Hannibal. The holiday seems to have entered the calendar on a regular basis ten years later. Usually only the last day featured chariot racing.
