Women's Equality Day: {US} Celebrates the fight for, and progress towards, equality for women. Established by the United States Congress in 1971 to commemorate two anniversaries: Passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ensuring Woman Suffrage in 1920 and a nation-wide demonstration for equal rights, the Women's Strike for Equality, in 1970. Day the U.S. Constitution's 19th Amendment went into effect, recognizing women's right to vote (1920). [The 19th Amendment was approved by Congress on 6/4/1919 and, after ratification by the states, was proclaimed in effect on 8/26/1920.]
