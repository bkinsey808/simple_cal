America Recycles Day: {US, Earth} Getting organized is all about cleaning out items you don't need -- clutter that has been doing nothing but taking up space in your life.

So many of the things that end up in the "get rid of pile" -- plastic and glass containers, cardboard boxes, old magazines, junk mail, video tapes, batteries, packing peanuts, etc. -- can be RECYCLED. The biggest challenge is knowing where to take them so they don't end up in the dumpster. So this month, let's concentrate on reducing the amount of trash that goes into a landfill -- and increasing the quantity of recyclables.
