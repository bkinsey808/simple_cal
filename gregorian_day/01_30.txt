Fred Korematsu Day: {Civil Rights} First day in the U.S. dedicated to a person of Asian descent. In 1942, 23 year-old Fred Korematsu refused to report to the government’s incarceration camps for Japanese Americans. He was arrested and quickly convicted of defying the government’s unjust order, but decided to take his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. He was denied his freedom by the nation’s highest court, which validated the wholesale imprisonment of Japanese American citizens on the basis of “military necessity.” In 1983-1984, the Asian Law Caucus was a key member of the legal team that re-opened Fred’s case and convinced a federal court to overturn his conviction.
