Festum Asinorum, The Feast of the Ass, Fête de l'âne: {Roman} a medieval, Christian feast celebrating the Flight into Egypt. It was celebrated primarily in France, as a by-product of the Feast of Fools celebrating the donkey-related stories in the Bible, in particular the donkey bearing the Holy Family into Egypt after Jesus's birth. This feast may represent a Christian adaptation of the pagan feast, Cervulus, integrating it with the donkey in the nativity story. 

Thorrablot: {Asatru} This holiday began the Old Norse month of Snorri. It is still observed in Iceland with parties and a mid-winter feast. It is of course sacred to Thorr and the ancient Icelandic Winter Spirit of Thorri. Perform blot to Thorr and invite the mighty Asaman to the feast.
