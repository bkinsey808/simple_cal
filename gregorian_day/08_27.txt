Global Forgiveness Day:
		
Volturnalia: {Roman} To Volturnus, god of the Tiber River. 

Birthday of Rabbi Yisrael Ben Eliezer (Israel Baal Shem Tov): (1698), Kabbalistic mystic and founder of Hasidic Judaism. He believed that the whole Universe and all things are manifestations of Deity and that nothing can be separated from Deity. [Because of the Divine within, he believed all are inherently good. He rejected asceticism, embracing joy from the sense of oneness with the Divine, and emphasized service to Deity out of love, not fear.] [Death day 5/22/1760] [a/k/a Yisroel Ben Eliezer, Baal Shem Tov (Master of the Good Name), the holy Baal Shem, and the Besht]
