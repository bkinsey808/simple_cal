World Standards Day: celebrated internationally each year on October 14th. The day honours the efforts of the thousands of experts who develop voluntary standards within standards development organizations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The aim of World Standards Day is to raise awareness among regulators, industry and consumers as to the importance of standardization to the global economy. October 14 was specifically chosen to mark the date, in 1946, when delegates from 25 countries first gathered in London and decided to create an international organization focused on facilitating standardization. Even though ISO was formed one year later, it wasn't until 1970 that the first World Standards Day was celebrated. Each year, ISO determines a theme based on a current aspect of standardization.
