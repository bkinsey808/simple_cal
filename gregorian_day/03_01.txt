Kalends of March: {Roman} Originally this was the day to re-kindle the perpetual fire representing the life of Rome at the Temple of the Vestals. Fresh laurels were hung on public buildings. At the same time it was festival to Mars with dances of the priestly college (Salii) continuing for nineteen days. The dancers held sacred shields during the ceremony and dined out at a different house each night. These multiple festivals to Mars make sense not just because the month, Martius, was named for him, but also because this was the time of year when the soldiers were called up for the year's campaigns. 

Ancient Roman New Year: {Roman} March 1st was the first day of the year according to the calendar used before the reforms of Julius Caesar. To commemmorate the day, the Vestal Virgins re-kindled the sacred fire in Vesta's temple in Rome.

Matronalia: {Roman} During this festival Roman women would visit Juno's temple on the Esquiline. Their husbands would stay at home to pray, and give their wives money and other presents when the women returned home from the temple. Female household slaves were given a feast hosted by their mistress. During Matronalia the Vestal Virgins gave offerings of their hair to Juno Lucina in her sacred groves near Rome. Pregnant women would unbind their hair and clothing so as to prevent any restrictions that might carry over to their labour.
