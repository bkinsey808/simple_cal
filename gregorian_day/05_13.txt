Day the Humanist Manifesto was published: (1933). It exhorts people to affirm life, not deny it; engage life, not flee from it; and work towards the happiness of self and all. [The Humanist Manifesto asserts: humanity has evolved and is part of Nature; there is no dualism separating mind and body; religious culture has developed due to the environment; there is no distinction between sacred and secular; the goal is complete realization of human personality in the present life; people should focus on self-development and social work; there is no correct religious attitude concerning belief in the supernatural; people should learn to face life's crises as natural; people should work towards joy in living; all institutions exist for the fulfillment of human life; the profit-motivated society is inadequate--a socialized cooperative economic order must be established; life should be affirmed, not denied; life should be engaged, not fled from; people should work towards the happiness of all, not the few.]
