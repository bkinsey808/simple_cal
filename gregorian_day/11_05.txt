Guy Fawkes Night, Guy Fawkes Day, Gunpowder Day, Bonfire Night, Firework Night: an annual commemoration observed on 5 November, primarily in England. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. Celebrating the fact that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London, and months later the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.

Guy Fawkes Day, Bonfire Day, Gunpowder Day. Remember, remember the fifth of November. This day recalls the failed "Gunpowder Plot" which was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of England's Parliament on this day in 1605, as the prelude to a popular revolt in the Midlands during which King James's nine-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, was to be installed as the Catholic head of state. On message boards such as 4chan, the stylized Guy Fawkes mask from the V for Vendetta movie was used in a meme called "Epic Fail Guy", presumably referencing the epic failure of the gunpowder plot. The mask became associated with hacktivist group Anonymous's Project Chanology protests against the Church of Scientology in 2008, reacting to the fact that the Scientologists were being creepy and conducting surveillance against the protesters. What a lot of ppl don't understand is that Anonymous adopted the mask linked with Epic Fail Guy in a humorous, highly ironic manner, and not necessarily in support with the actual historic Gunpowder Plot.
