Cerialia, Ludi Ceriales: {Roman} April was a popular month for games as these games dedicated to the goddess of the harvest, Ceres, show. The first evidence for them is in 202 BC. A special feature of these Ludi was the release of foxes which had lit torches tied to their tails. This was probably supposed to avert danger to the crops. Usually only the last day featured chariot racing. Nor were they the last games in April. A festival with ludi ('games') in honor of Ceres. Ceres/Demeter's search for her lost daughter Proserpina was represented by women clothed in white, running about with lighted torches.
