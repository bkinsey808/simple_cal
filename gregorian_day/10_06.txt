Come and Take It Day:

German-American Day: {US}

Mad Hatter Day: Remember the Mad Hatter from Lewis Carroll's classic fantasy story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland? Do you recall what the paper tag said, which was stuck in the Mad Hatter's hat? The tag read "10/6." No one knows what that notation actually meant, but it surely stands for October 6th as well.

Noodle Day: {foodie}

Physicians' Assistants Day: Begun by Eugene Stead, M.D., a physician and instructor at Duke University Medical Center, in North Carolina, on October 6, 1965, this holiday is celebrated each year on this date. The first physicians' assistants turned their tassels and received their diplomas from Duke University on October 6, 1967.
