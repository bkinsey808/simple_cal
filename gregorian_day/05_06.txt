International No Diet Day: The International No Diet Day (INDD) is an annual celebration of body acceptance and body shape diversity. This day is also dedicated to promoting a healthy life style and raise awareness of the dangers and futility of dieting. International No Diet Day is observed on May 6, and its symbol is a blue ribbon, similar to the red ribbon of the World AIDS Day. International No Diet Day was created by Mary Evans Young in 1992. Mary is the director of the British group "Diet Breakers". After personally experiencing anorexia, she worked to help people appreciate themselves for what they are, and to appreciate the body they have.
