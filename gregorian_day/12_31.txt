Make Up Your Mind Day: Another year is almost over. Time to evaluate the past year and plan some changes for the next. But it can be hard to get excited over a VAGUE goal -- like "getting organized". This is a nebulous and rather punitive sounding term -- like you've been a screw-up all along! Let's focus instead on the POSITIVE. If you were to get organized, how would your life be better? You would be less stressed and have more time for yourself. Those items are actually your GOALS -- getting organized is just the vehicle to get you there. Once you have a clear objective that excites you, it is easier to get motivated and commit yourself to the work ahead.
