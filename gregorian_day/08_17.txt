National Head Day: {humor} It all began with a few friends sitting around talking about Valentine's Day. We felt that Valentine's Day, a holiday supposedly for couples, seemed to be focused largely on what the woman wanted. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that--we love women and enjoy treating them well. What we were looking for is a Holiday that was focused on what men want. And what do men want? Flowers? Candy? A fancy dinner? Not so much. Head seemed much more in line with what we want. So we created a holiday where men get what we want--head. Every National Holiday needs to be celebrated annually, so we needed to pick a date. We decided upon August, as there are no major holidays in this month. One of our fathers' birthday is August 17, and his name is Dick. It seemed appropriate. And so it was done: August 17 would be National Head Day.
