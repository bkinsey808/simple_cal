Ludi Appollinares: {Roman} In 212 BC, some years after Hannibal and his Carthaginians had inflicted a horrible defeat at Cannae and Syracuse and Macedon had joined Rome's enemies, the prophecies of one Marcius came to light, according to Marcius. This prophecy had two parts, the first, to avoid battle at a place called "Canna". Romans were all too ready to identify this with their recent horrendous defeat at Cannae. The second said that to avoid such problems the Romans must have a special festival for Apollo in the Greek fashion. The Sibylline books were consulted to determine the correct rites. In 208 BC there was a biological plague so the Ludi Apollinares were repeated. Like the Ludi Romani these games proved so popular that they were instituted in the calendar as a regular event. Usually only the last day featured chariot racing. One wonders though whether the prophecies of Marcius were written before or after Cannae and what role the priests of Apollo had in their publication. 

Feriae Ancillarum: {Roman} "Feast of the Serving Women". During this festival, Rome's female slaves would dress up in the finest clothes they had and would attack men of free birth with fig boughs.
