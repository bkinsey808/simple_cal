Occult Day: day of knowledge of the hidden and the paranormal, as opposed to knowledge of the measurable, or science. Sometimes occult is taken to mean knowledge that is meant only for certain people or that must be kept hidden, but for most practising occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond pure reason and the physical sciences. The terms esoteric and arcane have very similar meanings, and in most contexts the three terms are interchangeable. Occult also describes a number of magical organizations or orders, the teachings and practices taught by them, and to a large body of current and historical literature and spiritual philosophy related to this subject.
