Ravioli Day: {foodie}

Bockbier Day: {foodie} Centuries ago, German monks adopted this hearty dark brew as “liquid bread” to provide them with carbohydrates and calories as they fasted during Lent. Some believe the name bock came from the shortening of einbeck and thus beck to bock. Others believe it is more of a pagan or old-world influence that the beer was only to be brewed during the sign of the Capricorn goat, and that bock means goat in German. In Europe, pictures of knights fighting in wars or goats ready to ram would portray the strength of the beer.
