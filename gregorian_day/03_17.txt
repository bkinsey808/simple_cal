St. Patrick's Day: A celebration of Irish heritage and culture, based on the Roman Catholic feast of Saint Patrick. Primary activity is simply the wearing of green clothing ("wearing o' the green"), although drinking beer dyed green is also popular. Attending St. Patrick's Day parades has historically been more popular in the United States than in Ireland. Old European festival marking rebirth of Viridios/the Green Man/Green George (God as deciduous vegetation); merged with the Christian feast of St. Patrick

Liberalia: {Roman} To Liber and Libera, a celebration of freedom from evil, burdens, care and folly. Also a continuation of the celebration for Mars during his month. This was the day for boys, who still wore the toga praetexta to assume the toga virilis – manly gown – and declare their adulthood, pending the permission of the paterfamilias, of course, usually on the occurrence falling nearest their sixteenth birthday.
