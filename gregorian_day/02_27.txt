Equirria I: {Roman} Originally not an official festival, but celebrated by adherents to Mithraism as the birth of the new sun. The Emperor Aurelian was devoted to a single sun god and during his reign it became a public festival complete with chariot-racing in the Circus. He erected a temple to Sol Invictus in AD 274.
