International Day of Families: {UN}	

Day of Solidarity with Palestine:

Mercuralia: {Roman} Mercuralia is a Roman celebration known also as the "Festival of Mercury". Mercury  was thought to be the god of merchants and commerce. On May 15 merchants would sprinkle their heads, their ships and merchandise, and their businesses with water taken from the well at Porta Capena.

Ides of May: {Roman} The May observance also saw merchants paying homage to Mercury as it was the founding day of his temple. Water was sprinkled to ask forgiveness for past lies and to ask for the success of new deceits in the future. They were also supposed to pay ten per cent of their profits to the shrine. Also a sacrifice day for the Tiber River: On this day the Vestal Virgins made a sacrifice to the Tiber River to convince it to bring a steady supply of water to the city of Rome for the rest of the growing season.
