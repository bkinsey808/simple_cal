Indigenous Peoples Day, Native Americans' Day, Columbus Day (Traditional), Dia de la Raza: Commemorates Europeans' colonization of America (1492); day to mourn Native American victims of conquest and oppression (past and present), make peace, and celebrate empowerment of Native Americans. While some Europeans brutally subjugated the indigenous peoples of the Americas (North and South) in the past, not all Europeans at the time approved of that subjugation. And no ethnic European alive today participated in that subjugation. While it is appropriate to expect atonement from the governments of the countries that participated, it is immoral to blame all ethnic Europeans today for the evil committed by some Europeans in the past. October 12th has historically been known as Columbus Day in America. In 1937, 32nd President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt actually proclaimed the date to be a national holiday. However, in 1971, American celebrations of Columbus Day were switched to the second Monday of October each year. Even so, October 12th is the traditional date for Columbus Day, a day of both celebration and controversy.
