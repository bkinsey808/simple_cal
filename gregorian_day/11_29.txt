International Day of Solidarity with Palestinian People: {UN} More than 40% of people in Gaza - nearly 50% of youth - are now unemployed and 80% of people receive international aid. Many key industries, such as the construction industry, have been decimated as essential materials are not allowed into Gaza. Exports are currently at less than 3% of their pre-blockade levels, with the transfer of agricultural produce and other goods to the West Bank and exports to Israel entirely banned.

Saturnia: {Roman} This festival honored the sons of Saturn: Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto.

Square Dance Day: {dance}
