Vestalia: {Roman} Vesta was celebrated at the Vestalia which took place from June 7 to June 15. On the first day of the festivities the penus Vestae (the curtained sanctum sanctorum of her temple) was opened, for the only time during the year, for women to offer sacrifices in. Such sacrifices included the removal of an unborn calf from a pregnant cow.

Ludi Piscatorii: {Roman} These were a private celebration of games by the fishermen of the Tiber River.
