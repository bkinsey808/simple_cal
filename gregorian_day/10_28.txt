Day the world's nations committed to biodiversity and ecosystem conservation: {UN, Earth}  (1982). [The World Charter For Nature was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on 10/28/1982.]

International Animation Day: proclaimed in 2002 by the ASIFA as the main global event to celebrate the art of animation. This day commemorates the first public performance of Emile Reynaudâ€™s Theatre Optique in Paris, 1892. In 1895, the Cinematograph of Lumiere brothers outshone Reynaud's invention, driving Emile to bancruptcy. However, his public performance of animation entered the history of optical entertainments as shortly predating the camera-made movies.
