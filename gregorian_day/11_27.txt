Pins and Needles Day: To commemorate the opening of the pro-Labor play Pins and Needles on Broadway on this day in 1937. Over decades of time, people lost track of the original meaning of this day. Today, most people look upon Pins and Needles Day, as a nervous and anxious day. Its a day of eager anticipation, as we await an event or for something to happen.
