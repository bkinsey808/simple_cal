Fairy Tale Day

For Pete’s Sake Day': Once upon a time, people used the expression “for the love of God” in its purest sense, but then in the early1800’s, one carriage driver yelled at another carriage driver with annoyance, “For the love of God, get out my way!” and the ladies in the coach were shocked at the brutal blasphemy. Of course, the curse caught on, and more women swooned, so a committee was formed. Arguments were had and the name Mike was chosen to replace God and “for the love of Mike” became the curse of choice in the 1880s. This worked for a while before the mother of children named Mike (and there were many) got fed up with strangers yelling out their children’s names in irritation and would respond, “For pity sake, watch your tongue around my boy Mike.” People began to take pity on the children named Mike, so “for pity sake” took over. Perhaps because someone was hard of hearing, it became “for Pete’s sake” in 1918, and has remained a popular expression ever since.
