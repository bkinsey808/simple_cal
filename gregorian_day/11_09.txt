Birthday of Fr. Thomas Berry: {Earth} (1914), Catholic priest, eco-theologian, and cosmologist, who advocates for deep ecology and eco-spirituality. [He believes the Universe, our Solar System, and planet Earth, in themselves, and in their evolutionary emergence, constitute the primary revelation of the ultimate Mystery from which all things emerge into being.]
