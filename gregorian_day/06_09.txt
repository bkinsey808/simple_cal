This festival was held to honor Vesta. During the festival, bakers and millers took a vacation, and decorated their millstones and working donkeys with violets and other small flowers. As part of the festival, the temple of Vesta was opened to women from June 7 through June 15. Also on June 15 the trash and other detria were swept out of the temple and into an alleyway to be dumped into the Tiber River.
