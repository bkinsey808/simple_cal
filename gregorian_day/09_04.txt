Ludi Plebeii, Plebeian Games: {Roman} This set of games was established in 220 BCE to honor Jupiter. They were opened with a procession of Rome's magistrates and priests that wound from the Capitoline through the Forum along the via sacra to the Circus Maximus. The first week of the games was set aside for plays and other types of theatre. The last three days were reserved for athletic events, and events in the Circus Maximus.
