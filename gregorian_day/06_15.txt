Global Wind Day: Day to promote wind power as a safe, clean, and renewable energy. [Wind power can make us energy independent. Wind power does not pollute and can replace polluting forms of energy that cause climate change. Nuclear meltdowns release deadly radiation. Oil spills kill water bodies. Natural gas fracking poisons drinking water. Coal mining destroys mountains and kills miners. Wind power does not.] [Solar power, geothermal power, and tidal power are also safe, clean, renewable energies.]

Smile Power Day:
