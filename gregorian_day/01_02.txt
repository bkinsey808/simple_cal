Compitalia: {Roman} In honor of the Lares Compitales, household deities of the crossroads. Sacrifices were offered at the places where two or more ways meet. Sacrifices consisted of honey-cakes (πέλανοι). Also, garlic and poppies are offered to Mania, mother of the Lares, for the well-being of the household. Each family placed the statue of the underworld goddess Mania at the door of their house. They also hung up at their doors figures of wool representing men and women, accompanying them with humble requests that the Lares and Mania would be contented with those figures, and spare the people of the house. The festival was led by slaves and in later years by freed slaves.
