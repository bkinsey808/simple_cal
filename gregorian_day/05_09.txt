Schuman Day: {Europe} commemorating the historical declaration of the EU by French foreign minister Robert Schuman.

Lemuria I: {Roman} The days when the ghosts of the dead were out and about.

Day the world's nations committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing climate change: (1992); day to mourn the failure of the U.S. to reduce these emissions. [Framework Convention on Climate Change: adopted on 5/9/1992; signed 6/4/1992; entered into force on 3/21/1994.] [The Kyoto Protocol, which includes mandatory reduction goals, was adopted by 180 nations on 12/11/1997, signed on 3/16/1998, and entered into force on 2/16/2005.] [The U.S. has refused to sign the Protocol. Instead, on 2/14/2002, the U.S. announced a plan to use tax incentives, tied to the U.S. economy, to encourage industry to voluntarily reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. This policy will not actually result in a reduction of emissions. Rather, it will result in continued increases in emissions. (Greenpeace estimates emissions will increase 25-30%.) The U.S. is the biggest polluter on the planet. 1/4 of the planet's carbon dioxide emissions is emitted by the U.S.]
