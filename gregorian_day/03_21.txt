Naw-Rúz: {Bahai} The Baha’i New Year’s Day coincides approximately with the spring equinox. Naw-Ruz is an ancient Persian festival celebrating the "new day" and for Baha'is it marks the end of the annual 19-Day Fast and is one of the nine holy days of the year when work is suspended.  Month of Bahá (splendor) begins.

World Puppetry Day: The idea came from the puppet theater Dzhivada Zolfagariho from Iran. In 2000 at the XVIII Congress of the Union Internationale de la Marionnette (UNIMA) in Magdeburg, he made the proposal for discussion. Two years later, at a meeting of the International Council of UNIMA in June 2002 in Atlanta, Georgia, the date of the celebration was identified. The first celebration was in 2003.
