Tibetan Uprising Day: Commemorates the 1959 Tibetan uprising against the presence of the People's Republic of China in Tibet. The failure of the armed rebellion ultimately resulted in a violent crackdown on Tibetan independence movements, and the flight of the Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso into exile. Tibetan Uprising Day is observed primarily by organizations and individuals who support Tibetan independence,[citation needed] such as Students for a Free Tibet, and is often accompanied by the release of a statement by the Dalai Lama. Tibetan independence groups often organize protests or campaigns on March 10th to draw attention to the situation in Tibet.
