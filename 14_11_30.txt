Sunday (Sun day 1/7)

Advent Sunday: (Adventus is Latin for "coming", the translation of the Greek word parousia, commonly used to refer to the Second Coming of Christ) The fourth Sunday before Christmas Day, the Sunday nearest to St. Andrew's Day (and this year exactly on St. Andrew's day), and the Sunday following the Feast of Christ the King. Begins the Advent Season, a season of penitence observed in many Western Christian churches as a time of expectant waiting and preparation for the celebration of the Nativity of Jesus at Christmas. For Christians, the season of Advent anticipates the coming of Christ, offers the opportunity to share in the ancient longing for the coming of the Messiah, and to be alert for his Second Coming.

St. Andrew's Day {Christian}: Apostle Andrew is said to have been martyred by crucifixion at the city of Patras (Patræ) in Achaea, on the northern coast of the Peloponnese. Early texts, such as the Acts of Andrew known to Gregory of Tours, describe Andrew as bound, not nailed, to a Latin cross of the kind on which Jesus is said to have been crucified; yet a tradition developed that Andrew had been crucified on a cross of the form called Crux decussata (X-shaped cross, or "saltire"), now commonly known as a "Saint Andrew's Cross" — supposedly at his own request, as he deemed himself unworthy to be crucified on the same type of cross as Jesus had been.

Cities for Life Day: Cities around the world celebrate the first abolition of the death penalty by a European state, decreed by Peter Leopold Joseph of Habsburg-Lorraine in 1786 for his Grand Duchy of Tuscany. On this occasion the participating cities show their commitment for life and against the death penalty.

‘Olekūklu (third ‘Ole day 8/30) {Hawai'ian}: The farmer thinks little of this day. A good night for torch-fishing. Seas rough during the day with tide low.

Śukla Navami (waxing tithi 9/15), Ritka (Empty 4/5), Pūrva Bhādrapadā (Markab nakshatra 25/27), Harṣaṇa (Causing Delight yoga 15/27) {Hindu}: ruled by Durga, who is caring and combines all powers (represented by the 10 weapons in her arms) for bringing situations into peace and harmony. Also ruled by Nagas. The deity of this nakshatra is Ajaikapada the "one footed goat" a form of Rudra or and ancient fire dragon. Ajaikpada is viewed as a form of Shiva, and a vehicle for the transport of Agni (fire), representing the cleansing spiritual power of fire. Harṣaṇa is the yoga of the thrill of hair standing erect, as well as of the lingam.
