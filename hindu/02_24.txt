Apara Ekadasi, Achala Ekadashi, Bhadrakali Ekadashi, Viashakha Vadi Ekadashi, Jalakrida Ekadashi: In northern regions, like Punjab, Haryana and places of Jammu and Kashmir, the ritual is known as Bhadrakali Ekadashi and is considered one of the most propitious days for worshipping Goddess Bhadra Kali. This is an important festival for the Aryan Saraswat Brahmin sect. On the other hand in Orissa, this vrat is referred to as Jalakrida Ekadashi, which is dedicated to Lord Jagannath in Puri. The Apara Ekadashi vrat is observed from sunrise till the sunrise on the next day. While Apara Ekadashi vrat calls for a strict fasting, people also opt for observing a partial fast. In such a case, they are allowed to consume fruits and milk only. Most importantly, food containing rice and grains should be avoided. In some parts of India, Sabudana Khichadi is eaten by those observing a partial vrat.
