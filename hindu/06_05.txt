Rishi Panchami: The idea behind observance of Vrata on this day is to express respect, gratitude and remembrance of the deeds of those ancient Rishis who devoted their life for the cause of society. If performed by women it is believed, that any ill deeds which they might have committed and the mistakes done, could be washed out by doing this Vrata. It is told to remember the Rishis like Kashyap, Atri, Bharadwaj, Vishwamitra, Gautam, Janadagni and Vashishtha. Near the North Pole there are seven ‘Nakshatras’, which are popularly known as ‘Saptarshi’. They are called so, purposely to remember the names of the Rishis permanently. During the observance of this Vrata, the women should visit river or any water storage in the afternoon, take cow dung with them, clean their teeth with medicinal herbal stick, take cold-water bath. They should arrange the idol of Saptarshi on small wooden platform in the form of seven bettlenuts and perform pooja. On this day they should eat only those fruits, which grow below the earth (soil) and strictly avoid eating any eatables, which are prepared from the grains grown from the toiling of bullocks. This is what is told as a procedure. he Jains regard this a very important day. Among them, the followers of Shwetambar cult end their Parjushan Maha Parva on this day and the others following Digambar cult, start their Maha Parva from this day. ‘Rhushabhadeva’ was the first and the most sacred Teerthankar as per the Jains. He is known as Aadinath also. ‘Rishi Panchami’ day is observed in the name of this Aadinath. The motive of such observance between the Hindus and the Jains is the same.
