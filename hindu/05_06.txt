Kalki Jayanti: t is believed that in Kali Yuga, the present Era, Lord Vishnu will appear for the total annihilation of evil and the establishment of ‘Dharma.’ Vishnu devotees believe it will take place on the sixth day in the bright fortnight of Shravan month. The Kalki Jyanthi is a unique observance as it celebrates the arrival of Lord Vishnu in future. It is also believed that Kalki Avatar will totally destroy the present world. Since the world has gone utterly corrupt with adharmic activities, it is believed the Kalki Avtar will bring an end to the present cycle of the universe and after a span of darkness creation will begin once again. There is also a certain section in Hindu society that believes that the avatar has already taken place.
