Ranga Panchami:

Chaiti Karna: On panchami, the dey before chhath, the pavitrans observe a fast for the whole day, which ends in the evening a little late after sunset. Just after the worship of earth, the offerings of Rasiao-kheer (rice delicacy), puris (deep-fried puffs of wheat flour) and bananas - are distributed among family and friends. From this day onwards, for the next 36 hours, the parvatin goes on a fast without water.
