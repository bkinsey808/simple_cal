The ritual consists of performing a shraddha (the exact details of this should be found out from a priest / pandit), and giving offerings / gifts to a sumangali / suhagan. In exceptional circumstances, if a son is unable to perform the ritual, it can be performed by the woman's younger brother-in-law or a nephew. If the son is at a location where he cannot perform the ritual, he may ask one of the above relatives to perform it. The sons must eat only one meal on the day, and give gifts to a sumangali.
