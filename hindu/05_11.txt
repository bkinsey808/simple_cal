Shravana Putrada Ekadashi, Pavitropana Ekadashi, Pavitra Ekadashi: On this day, 24 hours fasting is observed and worship is offered to the god Vishnu (like other ekadashis) by both husband and wife in particular, who do not have a son for a long time after marriage, to beget a male child. This day is especially observed by Vaishnavas, followers of Vishnu. A son is considered entirely important in Hindu society as he takes care of the parents in their old age in life and by offering shraddha (ancestor rites) ensures well-being of his parents in the after-life. While each ekadashi has a separate name and is prescribed for certain goals, the goal of having sons is so great that two Putrada ("giver of sons") ekadashis are devoted to it. Rest of the goals do not enjoy this privilege. It also highlights the preference to have sons instead of daughters.
