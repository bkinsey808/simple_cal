Vaikunta Ekadasi: considered the most important ekadasi of the year; According to Padma Purana, the female energy of Lord Vishnu slayed demon Muran in the form of a damsel and protects `Devas'. Impressed by the act, Lord Vishnu names her as `Ekadashi' and gives her the boon that those who worship `Ekadashi' on the day of her victory over Muran would reach `Vaikunth' (His abode); According to Vishnu Purana, fasting on Vaikunta Ekadashi is equivalent to fasting on the remaining 23 Ekadashis of the (Hindu) year.
