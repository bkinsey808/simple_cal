Chandra Shashti: The fast is observed by unmarried women.  At many places, girls in the first year of marriage observe this fast. The unmarried girls and the girls in the first year of their marriage get up early in the morning before the sun rises. Then, they take bath in a pond, well, pool or puddle. But, now-a-days girls take bath at home. They worship in the temple after their ablutions. They fast for whole day. In the evening, a pot filled with water or a Kalasha is kept on a wooden board. A Swastik is made on that pot or Kalasha. Seven Swastiks can be made on the pot. Seven dots can also be put on the Swastik. After that, the story of the fast is heard by taking wheat or rice in hand.
