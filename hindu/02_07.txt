Ganga Saptami, Jahnu Saptami, Ganga Jayanti, Ganga Pujan: Ganga was reborn on this day. As per mythology, Ganga descended on the Earth on Ganga Dussehra. When the holy river had descended, Lord Shiva stopped her in his hair so that it may not sweep the whole earth away. Later, the Lord released Ganga so that she can accomplish her mission to purge the cursed souls of Bhagirath's ancestors. "Coming down to earth, the Ganga crossed the ashram of sage Jahnu. The force of water destroyed the ashram due to which the sage got angry. The sage than drank all the water of Ganga. After this, Bhagirath prayed to sage Jahnu to release Ganga so that she could proceed on her mission. Pleased with prayers, Jahnu released Ganga from his ear," Atul Mishra, a priest, said. According to legends, Jahnu Rishi released Ganga from his ear on Saptami of Vaishakha Shukla Paksha. Because of this legend, this day is also known as Jahnu Saptami or Ganga Saptami.
