Nirjala Ekadashi, Pandava Bhima Ekadashi: The ekadashi derives its name from the water-less (Nir-jala) fast observed on this day. It is considered as the most austere and hence, most sacred of ekadashis. If observed religiously, it is said the most rewarding and granting the virtue gained by the observance of all 24 ekadshis in the year.
