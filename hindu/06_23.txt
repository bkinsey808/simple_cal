Mahalakshmi Vrata, Varalakshmi Vrata: is a special vrata or fast dedicated to Hindu Goddess ‘Mahalakshmi,’ or as the name implies ‘Great Lakshmi’ (maha = great). Lakshmi is the presiding deity of wealth, prosperity, light, wisdom, fortune, fertility, generosity and courage. These eight facets of Lakshmi give rise to another name for the goddess — ‘Ashtalakshmi’ (ashta = eight).
