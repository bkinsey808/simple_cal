Karmada Ekadashi: After taking bath in the morning of Kamada ekadashi, the devotee observes a fast. Worship is also offered to Vishnu in the form of Krishna, often in a nearby temple. The religious merit gained from this vrata is believed to grant all desires, to cleanse even the most heinous sin one committed (like murder of a Brahmin) and to free the devotee or his family members from curses.
