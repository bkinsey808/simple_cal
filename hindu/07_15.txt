Sharad Purnima, Kojagari Purnima: a harvest festival, a traditional celebration of the moon. At night, goddess Lakshmi is worshiped and night vigil is observed. According to a folk-tale, once a king fell on evil days, and was in great financial straits, but then his queen observed this fast and night vigil, and worshiped the goddess of wealth, Laxmi. Consequently, they were blessed by the goddess and they regained their prosperity. It is also believed that on this day as moon and the earth are very close to each other, the moon rays have certain healing properties of nourishing the body and the soul. The night is spent worshiping Lakshmi and Indra, and in games of chance. As per the popular Hindu belief, Lord Krishna has begun his divine Raas Lila with Radha and Gopis on the Sharat Purnima night. On Sharad Purnima day, devotees observe vigil and perform Lakshmi Puja. This day falls on Sharad ritu hence it is called as Sharad Poornima.
