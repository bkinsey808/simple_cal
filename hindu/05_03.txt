Madhusrava Tritiya, Hariyali Teej: dedicated to Goddess Parvati.  In some regions, Hariyali Teej is dedicated to the eternal love of Lord Krishna and Radha. Some Hindu communities worship Chand or Chandra – the moon god - on the day. The day is also of great importance in Vrindavan. Numerous fairs and festivals are also observed on the day in many parts of North India, especially in Rajasthan where color processions of the idols of Goddess Parvati are taken out.  Songs celebrating the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati are sung on this day. Special swings are made for Hariyali Teej and women swing on them. Another important ritual is the applying of henna – artistic drawings on hands. Hariyali Teej is one among the three Teej Festivals the other two being Hartalika Teej and Kajari Teej.
