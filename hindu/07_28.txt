Dhana Trayodashi, Dhanteras: money lenders and others worship money. 'Yama-Deep-Dan' is held wherein mothers and wives make one ‘divas’ each for all living male in the family. The diva, made from the kneaded flour is lit and offered to Lord Yama in the evening. As they perform the ritual womenfolk pray to Lord Yama - the Hindu mythological God of Death that their husbands and sons be blessed with a long life.
