Kamika Ekadashi: On this day of Ekadashi one must perform due respects and poojan to the Almighty Supreme God with fresh flowers and tulsi leaves. One must keep a divo (holy candle) in front of God and sing His praise with great joy and perform continuous devotion. During the night, one should perform jagran, sing bhajans, kirtans and chant the name of Bhagwan Supreme.
