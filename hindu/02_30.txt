Mata Tirthi Puja, Matatirtha Puja: In the Napalese calendar, a day when one shows appreciation and gratitude to one's mother

Savitri Brata, Savitri Amavasya, Vat Savitri Amavas Puja, Vat Savithri Amavasi Vrat: a fasting day observed by all Hindu Oriya married women on the Amavasya, the last day of the dark fortnight, in the month of Jyestha. Married Hindu women, whose husbands are alive, observe it as a vow with great dedication and pray for their husband to have a long life. The word reflects the origin and significance of the Vat-Savitri puja. The fast is dedicated to Savitri and Satyavan; her husband who was destined to die within one year but was brought back to life by her penance. The God of death, Yama, is implored by Savitri when he is about to leave his body. Due to her sheer determination and devotion to her husband, she won him back to life. Soon Satyavan regained his lost kingdom.
