Shayani Ekadashi, Vishnusayan Otsava, Sayani, Vishnusayani Ekadashi:  This holy day is of special significance to Vaishnavas, followers of Hindu preserver god Vishnu. On this day images of Vishnu and Lakshmi are worshipped, the entire night is spent singing prayers, and devotees keep fast and take vows on this day, to be observed during the entire chaturmas, the holy four month period of rainy season. These may include, giving up a food item or fasting on every Ekadashi day. It is believed that Vishnu falls asleep in Ksheersagar.

Chaturmas, Chaturmasya Vrata: four months of the year reserved for penance, austerities, fasting, bathing in holy rivers and religious observances for all. Devotees resolve to observe some form of vow, be it of silence or abstaining from a favourite food item, or having only a single meal in a day.
