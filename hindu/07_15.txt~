Sharad Purnima, Kojagari Purnima, Kumar Purnima: a harvest festival, a traditional celebration of the moon. At night, goddess Lakshmi is worshiped and night vigil is observed. According to a folk-tale, once a king fell on evil days, and was in great financial straits, but then his queen observed this fast and night vigil, and worshiped the goddess of wealth, Laxmi. Consequently, they were blessed by the goddess and they regained their prosperity. It is also believed that on this day as moon and the earth are very close to each other, the moon rays have certain healing properties of nourishing the body and the soul.
       
Gajalaxmi Puja: observed as the birthday of Laxmi, the Goddess of wealth.
