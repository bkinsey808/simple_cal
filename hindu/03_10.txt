Ganga Dasahara, Ganga Dussehra, Gang Avatara: descent of the Ganga to earth; when Jyaishtha is intercalary, the Dasahara falls in the first (intercalated) Jyaishtha. On this day, if a devotee is unable to visit and bathe in the river Ganga, then Ganga jal (water) kept in most Hindu homes is used for purification.
