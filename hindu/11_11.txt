Bhishma Ekadasi: It is believed that the Vishnu Sahasranama Stothram (thousand names dedicated to Lord Vishnu) was revealed to the Pandavas on this day by Bhisma, who was lying in a bed of arrows after the Great War in Mahabharat. This particular period in traditional Hindu calendar has numerous auspicious dates dedicated to Bhishma. Some of the important days are Bhishma Ashtami, Bhisma Dwadasi and Bhishma Ekadasi. It is believed that Bhishma chose this period to leave his body and merge with the Supreme Soul (Brahman).
