Varaha Jayanti: In Varaha avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as a boar in this world. A demon Hiranyaksha, had prayed for Lord Brahma and got awarded a boon that no beast nor man nor god could kill him. But somehow from the list of beasts the name of boar was missing. This proved to be his lacunae. He then started a campaign of plunder across the worlds. He pushed the world to the Pataal loka, or the under of the sea. He stole the Vedas, the holy scriptures from the Lord Brahma, while he was asleep and performed huge atrocities. To retrieve the Vedas and to save the world the Lord Vishnu assumed the role of a boar and brought out the earth from the under of the ocean, using its two tusks. It then killed Hiranyaksha and retrieved the Vedas from the asura and brought it back to the safe custody of the Lord Brahma. 

Haritalika, Hartalika Teej: a women’s festival celebrated by the females of India to enchant Goddess Parvati for her blessings. The blessings are targeted for good health and long life of the husbands of married women, whereas unmarried women pray for a husband like Lord Shiva. Indians believe that on this auspicious day, Goddess Parvati was accepted by Lord Shiva. As per the story, Mata Parvathy was in love with Shiva, but he was an ascetic and was not aware about her. In order to impress him, the goddess worshipped for many years in the Himalyas. Finally, Lord Shiva noticed Goddess Parvati and realized her love and devotion, and they got married. Since then, the goddess is being worshipped as ‘Hartalika’ and ‘Teej Mata’ by the Indian ladies.
