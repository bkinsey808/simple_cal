Chhath: The day is spent preparing the prasad (offerings) at home. On the eve of this day, the entire household accompanies the parvatins to a riverbank, pond or a common large water body to make the offerings(Arghya) to the setting sun. It is during this phase of Chhath Puja that the devotees offer prayers to the setting Sun. The occasion is almost a carnival. Besides the parvatin, there are friends and family, and numerous participants and onlookers, all willing to help and receive the blessings of the worshipper. Ritual rendition of regional folk songs, carried on through oral transmission from mothers and mothers-in-law to daughters and daughters-in-law, are sung on this occasion.
