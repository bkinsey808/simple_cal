Varuthini Ekadasi, Baruthani Ekadashi: Like all ekadashis, the god Vishnu, especially his fifth avatar Vamana, is worshipped. On Varuthini Ekadashi, certain rules are prescribed to be followed strictly. One should keep an all-night vigil, praying to God, singing devotional songs and hymns in the company of family members. One should not indulge in gambling, sports, sleep, anger, robbery, lying, being narrow minded, brushing one's teeth, exercise, shaving one's head, face or body, smearing oil on one's body and saying something bad about others. One should abstain from violence and any sexual activity. One should observe a fast (upavasa) and have only one meal. One should not eat meat, black gram, red lentil, chickpea, honey, betel nut, paan (betel nut leaves) and spinach. Eating in Bell metal utensils and eating in someone else's house is prohibited.[7] The Havishyanna food (boiled food without spices, salt and oil) offered to the yajna (fire sacrifice) on the previous day (10th lunar day - Dashami) should be consumed by the people observing this fast. Like the name of this holy day - Varuthini ("armoured/prtected") suggests, the devotee following this day's vrata (vow) is said to be protected from all harm and evil and gain good fortune.[5] Following all these rules on Varuthini Ekadashi is believed to usher prosperity, name and fame to the individual in the society.
