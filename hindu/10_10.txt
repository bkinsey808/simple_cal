Samba Dashami Vrat: Festival dedicated to Surya Bhagwan, mainly observed in Orissa. A popular legend explains that one son of the god Krishna, the vain and handsome Samba, once ridiculed a holy, although ugly, sage. The sage took his revenge by luring Samba to a pool where Krishna's consorts were bathing. While Samba stared, the sage slipped away and summoned Krishna to the  site. Enraged by his son's seeming impropriety with his stepmothers, Krishna cursed the boy with leprosy. Later he realized that Samba had been tricked, but it was too late to withdraw the curse. Samba then traveled to the seashore, where he performed 12 years penance to Surya who, pleased with his devotion, cured him of the dreaded disease. On this day, mothers perform Surya Puja to please Surya Bhagwan and to keep their children healthy.
