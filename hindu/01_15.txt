Hanuman Jayanti: On the day of Chaitra Shuddha Paurnima (Full Moon Day) the birth day of Bajarangbali Hanuman is celebrated in Temples of Hanuman.  Especially those who take regular exercise in gymnasium; practice wrestling and play adventure sports are devotees of Lord Hanuman because he is the God of Strength. Lord Hanuman himself was a devotee of Lord Shri Ram.  In many Hanuman Temples Kirtan, Bhajan, Pravachan (lectures) on Hanuman and Ramyana - one of the legendary epics - are arranged.
