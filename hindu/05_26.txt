Aja Ekadashi, Ananda Ekadashi: Legend has it that the great King Harishchandra got back his kingdom, wife and dead son after performing the Ananda or Aja Ekadashi. It was Gautama Muni who asked Harishchandra to observe the Annada Ekadasi so that he will be able to overcome all the difficulties in life. The king got back all that he had lost and was able to rule his kingdom without any difficulties.
